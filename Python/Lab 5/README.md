# Lab 5: Categorizing Values in a Mixed List

In this lab, you’ll learn how to loop through a list with **mixed data types** — and identify what each item is.

You’ll get comfortable with:
- Python’s `type()` function
- Using a `for` loop to inspect each value
- Understanding how Python treats numbers, strings, booleans, and more

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to store **multiple data types** in a single list  
- How to iterate through each item using a `for` loop  
- How to dynamically print the value **and** its type  
- Why `"45"` (a string) is different from `45` (an integer)

## 💻 Sample Output
45 is of the data type <class 'int'>

1.02 is of the data type <class 'float'>  
True is of the data type <class 'bool'>  
My dog is on the bed. is of the data type <class 'str'>
