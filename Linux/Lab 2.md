## üè∑Ô∏è Groups to Create

Create the following groups to represent departments and roles:

- sales
- hr
- finance
- personnel
- ceo
- shipping
- managers

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Instructions

### üë§ View Existing Users

You can list current users on the system by checking the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```

Or filter only actual human (non-system) users by checking for UID >= 1000:

```bash
awk -F: '$3>=1000{print $1}' /etc/passwd
```

You can also use:

```bash
getent passwd
```


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Groups

```bash
sudo groupadd sales
sudo groupadd hr
sudo groupadd finance
sudo groupadd personnel
sudo groupadd ceo
sudo groupadd shipping
sudo groupadd managers
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Users and Set Passwords

Use the following pattern to create users:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash arosalez
echo "P@ssword1234!" | sudo passwd --stdin arosalez
```

> üìù For systems without `--stdin`, use:
```bash
echo "arosalez:P@ssword1234!" | sudo chpasswd
```

Repeat for each user using their respective User ID.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Users to Groups

Use the following command format:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sales,managers arosalez
sudo usermod -aG shipping eowusu
sudo usermod -aG shipping jdoe
sudo usermod -aG hr,managers ljuan
sudo usermod -aG finance,managers mmajor
sudo usermod -aG ceo mjackson
sudo usermod -aG sales nwolf
sudo usermod -aG shipping psantos
sudo usermod -aG hr smartinez
sudo usermod -aG finance ssarkar
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Group Membership

```bash
groups arosalez
groups ljuan
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Modify User Info

Change user's shell or additional settings:

```bash
sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh jdoe
sudo usermod -c "Finance Manager" mmajor
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Simulate User Login

Use `su` to simulate login as a created user:

```bash
su - arosalez
whoami
exit
```

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus Activities

- Try removing a user from a group using `gpasswd` or by editing `/etc/group`
- Lock and unlock a user account:
  ```bash
  sudo passwd -l jdoe
  sudo passwd -u jdoe
  ```

---

## üßπ Cleanup (Optional)

To remove users and their home directories:

```bash
sudo userdel -r arosalez
```

To delete a group:

```bash
sudo groupdel sales
```

Happy managing! üîê
